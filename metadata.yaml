description: What Katy Did is an 1872 children's book written by Sarah Chauncey Woolsey
  under her pen name Susan Coolidge. It follows the adventures of a twelve-year-old
  American girl, Katy Carr, and her family who live in the fictional lakeside Ohio
  town of Burnet in the 1860s. Katy is a tall untidy tomboy, forever getting into
  scrapes but wishing to be beautiful and beloved. When a terrible accident makes
  her an invalid, her illness and four-year recovery gradually teach her to be as
  good and kind as she has always wanted.
